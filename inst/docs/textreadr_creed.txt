The textreadr package aims to be a lightweight
tool kit that handles 80% of an analyst's text
reading in needs.

The package handles .docx, .doc, .pdf, .html, .pptx, and .txt.

If you have another format there is likely already
another popular R package that specializes in this
read in task.  For example, got XML, use the xml2
package, authored by Hadley Wickham, Jim Hester, &
Jeroen Ooms.  Need special handling for .html?  Use 
Hadley Wickham's rvest package.  Got SQL?  Oh boy 
there's a bunch of great ways to read it into R.
