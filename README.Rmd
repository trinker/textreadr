**textreadr** is a small collection of convenience tools for reading text documents into R.  This is not meant to be an exhaustive collection; for more see the [**tm**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html) package.

# Installation

To download the development version of **textreadr**:

Download the [zip ball](https://github.com/trinker/textreadr/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/trinker/textreadr/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **pacman** package to install the development version:

```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/textreadr")
```

# Demonstration

## Load the Packages?Data

```{r, message=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(textreadr, magrittr)
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/pathr")

trans_docs <- dir(
    system.file("docs", package = "textreadr"), 
    pattern = "^trans",
    full.names = TRUE
)

pdf_doc <- system.file("docs/rl10075oralhistoryst002.pdf", package = "textreadr")
docx_doc <- system.file("docs/Yasmine_Interivew_Transcript.docx", package = "textreadr")
```


## Download


`download` is simply a wrapper for `curl::curl_download` that allows multiple documents to be download, has the `tempdir` pre-set as the `destfile` (named `loc` in **textreadr**), and also returns the path to the file down load for easy use in a **magrittr** chain.

Here I download a .docx file of presidential debated from 2012.

```{r}
"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/61803503/pres.deb1.docx" %>%
    download() %>%
    read_docx() %>%
    head(3)
```

## Read .docx

A .docx file is nothing but a fancy container.  It can be parsed via XML.  The `read_docx` function allows the user to read in a .docx file as plain text.  Elements are essentially the p tags (explicitly `//w:p`) in the markup.  

```{r}
docx_doc %>%
    read_docx() %>%
    head(3)
```

```{r}
docx_doc %>%
    read_docx(19) %>%
    head(3)
```

## Read .pdf

Like .docx a .pdf file is simply a container.  Reading PDF's is made easier with a number of command line tools.  A few methods of PDF reading have been incorporated into R.  Here I wrap the stable, reliable **tm** port to produce `read_pdf`, a function with sensible defaults that is designed to read PDFs into R for as many folks as possible right out of the box.

Here I read in a PDF with `read_pdf`.  Notice the result is a data frame with meta data, including page numbers and element (row) ids.

```{r}
pdf_doc %>%
    read_pdf() 
```

[Carl Witthoft's](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9187015/1000343) word of caution is useful for those struggling to read image text into R.

> Just a warning to others who may be hoping to extract data: PDF is a container, not a format. If the original document does not contain actual text, as opposed to bitmapped images of text or possibly even uglier things than I can imagine, nothing other than OCR can help you.

## Read Transcripts

Many researchers store their dialogue data (including interviews and observations) as a .docx or .xlsx file.  Typically the data is a two column format with the person in the first column and the text in the second separated by some sort of separator (often a colon).  The `read_transcript` wraps up many of these assumptions into a reader that will extract the data as a data frame with a person and text column. The `skip` argument is very important for correct parsing.

Here I read in and parse the different formats `read_transcript` handles. These are the files that will be read in:

```{r}
basename(trans_docs)
```

### docx Simple

```{r}
read_transcript(trans_docs[1])
```

### docx With Skip

`skip` is important to capture the document structure.  Here not skipping front end document matter throws an error, while `skip = 1` correctly parses the file.

```{r,error=TRUE}
read_transcript(trans_docs[2])
read_transcript(trans_docs[2], skip = 1)
```

### docx With Dash Separator

The colon is the default separator.  At times other separators may be used to separate speaker and text.  Here is an example where hypens are used as a separator.  Notice the poor parse with colon set as the default separator the first go round.

```{r}
read_transcript(trans_docs[3],skip = 1)
read_transcript(trans_docs[3], sep = "-", skip = 1)
```

### xls and xlsx


```{r}
read_transcript(trans_docs[4])
read_transcript(trans_docs[5])
```

### Reading Text

Like `read.table` `read-transcript` also has a `text` argument which is useful for demoing code.

```{r}
read_transcript(
    text=

"34    The New York Times reports a lot of words here.
12    Greenwire reports a lot of words.
31    Only three words.
 2    The Financial Times reports a lot of words.
 9    Greenwire short.
13    The New York Times reports a lot of words again.",

    col.names = c("NO", "ARTICLE"), sep = "   "
)

```


### Authentic Interview

Here I read in an authentic interview transcript:

```{r}
docx_doc %>%
    read_transcript(c("Person", "Dialogue"), skip = 19)
```

## Read Directory Contents

Often there is a need to read multiple files in from a single directory.  The `read_dir` function wraps other **textreadr** functions and `lapply` to create a data frame with a document and text column (one row per document).  

```{r}
system.file("docs/Maas2011/pos", package = "textreadr") %>%
    read_dir()
```
