Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch



textreadr 0.6.0 -
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

NEW FEATURES

  argument like the other `read_` functions.

MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

CHANGES


textreadr 0.4.0 - 0.5.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* The README.md called for `ex_` functions from **qdapRegex**.  This was the dev
  version of **qdapRegex**.  This is now the CRAN version and now works for users.

NEW FEATURES

* `read_html` added for reading in the text from the body of .html documents.
  `read_document` inherits this ability as well.

MINOR FEATURES

* The low level read functions all now have consistent arguments: `skip`,
  `remove.empty`, & `trim` to ake their use more interoperable.

IMPROVEMENTS

* **textreadr** no longer uses the **antiword** program directly, instead the
  R antiword package is called for `read_doc`.  This makes installation across
  operating systems more standardized.

CHANGES

* The logo has been moved to tools to conform to CRAN standards.

* `read_doc`'s argument `format` is now `FALSE` by default rather than `TRUE` to
  be consistent with the other read functions.

* `read_docx` no longer uses the **XML** package but now uses **xml2** as
  suggested by Jeroen Ooms (see issue #7).



textreadr 0.3.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* `read_dir_transcript` added to complement `read-dir` aimed at a directory of
  transcripts.



textreadr 0.0.1 - 0.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

This package is a  collection of convenience tools for reading text documents
into R.
